    Sara began working in marketing in 2010, and repeatedly found herself in roles with strong technical components. She was consistently the most technical person on her team (and the nerdiest). After managing the development of an iPad application, she realized she wanted to start creating technology, not just using it.
    She began teaching herself programming in 2012, and when she left marketing and began working at New York University, Sara finally had a schedule that would let her explore and develop a passion for code. She took one course through Girl Develop It, then promptly took all the other courses they offered in New York.
    While planning a conference for the Information Systems department at NYU, Sara dove into the website’s code to update it herself. She loved it (and developed a deep respect for well-formatted code). She began putting any spare moments at work towards rebuilding the website, and those were the best moments at work she had ever had. She was hooked.
