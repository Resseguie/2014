  title: OculusHead (Keynote)
  body: >
    The project is a 3D printed robotic head for a telepresence immersive experience, the project includes movement of the 3D printed head and computer vision. Using the accelerometer that the Oculus Rift headset provides we are moving several servos that have webcams mounted, the goal is to mimic remotely the moves of a person wearing the headset. We have a node.js apps that obtains this data, process it and translate it to actuators plugged to an Arduino, OculusHead have movement on 3-axis with servos simulating almost all of the possible movements of a human head. 
    For the vision part we are using two webcams mounted on the servo system that can see in the same direction the user sees, this is real time streamed to a computer and can be visualized on the Oculus Rift headset plugged to this computer in a different location that the OculusHead is located. There are several filters applied to the source image to give the full immersive experience including the depth that's needed for the headset.
    The software part is implemented using JavaScript and node.js and libraries like vr.js, three.js, johnny-five and socket.io. We are currently working on printing a full head (based on InMoov project) and implementing more features of computer vision like face recognition and more image processing.

  title: "Prototyping: Materials and Methods"
  body: >
    When you build your own robots and gadgets, materials make all the difference. Working with conductive thread and flexible sensors changes what technology can do and how you build prototypes. 
    This talk explores prototyping through One Laptop per Child's drive for cheap, childproof science kits, and a new electronics kit that I am making with needle, thread, and beanbags.
    This is in part a story about developing DIY sensors that work in remote parts of the world, and finding local engineers to resolder what breaks. It's also a look inside education technology meetups, where projects with science fiction names were dreamed up, manufactured, and put to the test. The successes and failures of these prototypes point to a future for open hardware in education and the maker movement.

  title: Wearable Technology (NEEDS OFFICIAL TITLE)
  body: >
    Adding technology to clothing comes with some unique challenges. Instead of buying special technology for wearable items (the sew in Lilypad or Flora components, for example), you can design your wearable item to work well with electrical components you can buy anywhere. I’ll talk about the various things I’ve done for the wearable technology items I’ve created and give some tips that can be used on a wearable project of your own.

    3D Printing Guide
  bio: >
    Susan Hinton is a web developer by day, and hobby enthusiast by night. She's currently heavily immersed in the 3D printing scene, teaching and enabling others in the technology. Her latest weapon of choice is a Printrbot Jr, which has been tricked out with upgrades and experiments. In 2011, she released a 3D printed jewelry range at http://owlposse.com. Her idea of an ideal Friday night is 3D modeling jewelry and robots, accompanied by a glass or two of quality scotch. As a board member of SYN Shop the Las Vegas hackerspace, Susan maintains the rapid prototyping station there. She also runs a newsletter called 3D Print Weekly over at 3dprintweekly.com. She's probably attempting to 3D print a cat right now.

  title: Electronic Fundamentals (NEEDS OFFICIAL TITLE)
  body: >
    There comes a time when every roboticist builds a circuit that just doesn’t work, and they have to break out a multimeter to figure out what went wrong. Knowing how a multimeter works is just half the challenge though.
    Using a multimeter isn’t that different from using a software debugger. You need to know how to operate the tool of course, but you also need to know how to approach problems methodically such that you rule out possible issues until the culprit is found. This workshop will teach attendees how to use a multimeter to systematically debug problems in circuits by relating it to debugging software.
    The workshop will start with an overview of how to operator a multimeter, including how to measure voltage, current, and resistance. If necessary, an overview of these concepts and Ohm’s law will be covered. Attendees will measure the voltage of a battery, the resistance of a resistor, and the current through the resistor when connected to the battery. This will be the “see, the math works!” moment.
    Second half of the workshop will discuss common steps to take when diagnosing problems by trying to solve an actual broken circuit. The things that one should always check when diagnosing circuits that will be covered are:
    Check if there is power, analogous to “is this method being called”
    Check if the wires are connected correctly, analogous to “am I passing the correct number of arguments”
    Check if the signal passed on the wire is the correct type, analogous to “am I passing the correct types/values for each argument”
    Possible ideas for a broken circuit include a sensor board with a bad solder joint on a ground/power pin, a bad wire used to connect to a servo, etc. I will ensure that whatever problem there is does not introduce a short circuit for safety reasons, of course.

  title: Developing applications for FFOS phones as an augmentation to robotics projects.
  body: >
    Are you looking for a touchscreen for your project? How about a separate accelerometer? A camera? Sound? You can add all of these to your project for $80, programmed in web tech.
    The firefox os phones were meant to replace feature phones in developing countries, but I'd like to talk about the ways we can use these affordable devices to augment robotics projects. You can even use the code you write for them on any device with a browser!
    Also, any apps you write don't have to be submitted to a central app store for distribution- Mozilla gives you all the tools you need to allow installation of your FFOS app from any web site.
    This workshop assumes a basic knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS. We'll walk through using the simulator, defining a FFOS application from your web app, using Phone APIs, and how we can use these to augment existing robotics projects.

    Mike is a developer at GitHub. After having good friends playing with hardware for many years, he was inspired to bring some of this to GitHub. Starting with a 3D printer (now controlled by their company chat bot, Hubot), he has slowly worked to reignite the hardware hacking culture and make it easier for the open source hardware community to leverage GitHub for their needs.

    I intend to talk for a little bit about my own journey to becoming a Maker (becoming a software engineer, finding a hackerspace accidentally, getting to know people, taking classes) and then give a partially-serious, partially-humourous list and set of anecdotes on "things that happen/how you change when you become a Maker" (serious things like how my job widened and I had new opportunities at work and humourous things like "covert bathroom soldering" and "sparkfun evangelism").
