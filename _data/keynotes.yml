  title: OculusHead (Keynote)
  body: >
    The project is a 3D printed robotic head for a telepresence immersive experience, the project includes movement of the 3D printed head and computer vision. Using the accelerometer that the Oculus Rift headset provides we are moving several servos that have webcams mounted, the goal is to mimic remotely the moves of a person wearing the headset. We have a node.js apps that obtains this data, process it and translate it to actuators plugged to an Arduino, OculusHead have movement on 3-axis with servos simulating almost all of the possible movements of a human head.
    For the vision part we are using two webcams mounted on the servo system that can see in the same direction the user sees, this is real time streamed to a computer and can be visualized on the Oculus Rift headset plugged to this computer in a different location that the OculusHead is located. There are several filters applied to the source image to give the full immersive experience including the depth that's needed for the headset.
    The software part is implemented using JavaScript and node.js and libraries like vr.js, three.js, johnny-five and socket.io. We are currently working on printing a full head (based on InMoov project) and implementing more features of computer vision like face recognition and more image processing.

  title: Becoming A Maker
  body: >
    I intend to talk for a little bit about my own journey to becoming a Maker (becoming a software engineer, finding a hackerspace accidentally, getting to know people, taking classes) and then give a partially-serious, partially-humourous list and set of anecdotes on "things that happen/how you change when you become a Maker" (serious things like how my job widened and I had new opportunities at work and humourous things like "covert bathroom soldering" and "sparkfun evangelism").
  bio: >
    Jamie has been a career software engineer/computer scientist with NASA for 5 years. She joined the FamiLAB hackerspace in February 2012 and started learning hardware and electronics. Before she knew it, she was spending part of my work time in a rapid-prototyping R&D shop at KSC, teaching soldering at Orlando Mini Maker Faire, becoming treasurer and board member at FamiLAB, and offering arduino classes after work. Jamie distinctly recalls the moment when she realised that she was a Maker, when that switch flipped in her head from user/programmer/consumer to Maker.
